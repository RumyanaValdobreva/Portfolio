Welcome to My Portfolio!

Hey there! I'm Rumyana Valdobreva, a Junior Python Developer, and I'm so glad you’ve stopped by my portfolio. This website is a reflection of my journey as a developer, from writing my first “Hello World” to diving deeper into the world of programming that I’ve grown so passionate about.

Here’s a quick tour of what you’ll find:

- Home: This is where I introduce myself and what I do. I’m a fast learner, a team player, and always hungry for new challenges in tech!

- About Me: Want to know how I got started in coding and why I love it? This section tells the story of how my curiosity for programming turned into a passion and a career. Spoiler alert: the excitement hasn’t faded — it’s only grown!

- My Tech Stack: I’ve put together a visual guide of the tools and technologies I’ve been working with, from Python and JavaScript to HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL, and Django. I’m always expanding my skill set, and I love every bit of it.

- Certificates: Here you can check out some of the certificates I’ve earned along the way. They represent the milestones in my learning journey — everything from the basics of programming to more advanced, specialized skills.

- Contact Me: If you like what you see or think we could work together, feel free to reach out! There’s a contact form that makes it super easy to send me a message.

I’ve designed this site to be as user-friendly and responsive as possible, so whether you’re on a desktop or scrolling through on your phone, it’ll be a smooth experience.

Take a look around and don’t hesitate to get in touch if you’d like to chat more about development, opportunities, or anything tech-related!
